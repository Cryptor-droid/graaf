<h1>Why would I use graaf?</h1>
<p1>Because it uses randomly generated and encrypted keys to encrypt the actual files. Those keys called permission files and the best part of it, permission files can be stored on a usb stick and allows you to use usb sticks as keys.</p1>

<h2>Create Permission file.</h2>

<p1>Permission files will define the username and the password of your encrypted file<br>
  Create location option defines where to save.<br>
  The area that 1024 written on it defines randomly generated key length.<br>
